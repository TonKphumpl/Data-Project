## Data Labeling Process

The main steps involve two things primarily, columns I (sentiment) and J (topic). The process is divided into 3+1 optional steps briefly as follows:

1. Read the text in column B (message).
2. Optionally, click to view the original post at C (direct URL) or D (post URL).
3. Summarize the sentiment result in column I (positive, neutral, negative).
4. Summarize the topic result in column J, indicating what the subject is, such as design, price & promotion, finance & branding.

## Problem in messages of the real estate market in Thailand in April 2024 dataset

1. There is a confusing message that cannot be completely deciphered through coding alone, so it requires using common sense to make decisions. This means relying on intuition and practical judgment rather than solely on programming.

2. It's necessary to sort and separate information both manually and through coding techniques. This implies a combination of human judgment and automated processes to handle the data effectively.

3. There's a competition among brands associated with politics. This suggests that brands are actively engaging in political discourse or aligning themselves with certain political ideologies to gain attention or support.

4. Some messages are irrelevant to the political brand, such as store promotions, personal names, real estate listings for sale or rent, and so on. These messages do not pertain to the political aspect of the brand and need to be filtered out.

5. Messages come in various formats due to extracting them from diverse social media platforms.
